# TenantGuard
Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Middleware for ASP.NET Core

**Description**:

This library provides a middleware component for ASP.NET Core applications needing to support multi-tenancy and data isolation. The middleware enables developers to build multi-tenant applications where each tenant has its own isolated data storage, such as databases, tables, or schemas. It abstracts away the complexities of tenant management, data isolation, and access control, allowing developers to focus on building core application features.

**Features**:
1. **Tenant Resolution**: Implements mechanisms for resolving tenants based on request headers, hostnames, subdomains, or custom identifiers. Supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant applications.
2. **Data Isolation**: Provides strategies for isolating tenant data at the database level, such as using separate databases, schemas, or tables for each tenant. Ensures that tenants cannot access or modify data belonging to other tenants.
3. **Dynamic Database Connection Management**: Dynamically establish database connections for each tenant based on configured connection strings or database mappings. Handles database connection pooling, caching, and disposal efficiently.
4. **Tenant-Specific Configuration**: Allows developers to define and manage tenant-specific configuration settings, such as feature toggles, permissions, and customization options.
5. **Cross-Tenant Communication**: Facilitates communication and interaction between tenants when necessary, while ensuring proper data isolation and access control. Implements mechanisms for sharing common resources or data between tenants securely.
6. **Tenant Provisioning and Onboarding**: Provides APIs and tools for provisioning new tenants, onboarding customers, and managing tenant lifecycle (creation, activation, deactivation, deletion).
7. **Security and Compliance**: Enforces security best practices and compliance requirements in multi-tenant environments, including data encryption, access controls, auditing, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
8. **Scalability and Performance**: The middleware is designed to be highly scalable and performant, capable of handling large numbers of tenants and concurrent requests efficiently. It also provides caching, batching, and other optimization techniques to improve performance.
9. **Integration with Identity and Access Management (IAM) Systems**: Integrates with IAM systems such as Azure Active Directory, IdentityServer, or Okta for authentication, authorization, and user management in multi-tenant applications.
10. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**: Provides logging, monitoring, and diagnostics capabilities to track tenant-specific usage metrics, performance metrics, and errors for troubleshooting and optimization purposes.

**Target Audience**:

- SaaS (Software as a Service) companies building multi-tenant applications or platforms where data isolation and tenant customization are critical requirements.
  
- Enterprises developing cloud-native applications or microservices architectures that require support for multi-tenancy and tenant-specific data management.
  
- Independent software vendors (ISVs) looking to enable multi-tenancy in their existing applications or migrate to a multi-tenant architecture to reduce operational costs and improve scalability.

**Potential Use Cases**:

- Building multi-tenant CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) platforms, CMS (Content Management Systems), or e-commerce platforms where each tenant operates in isolation with its own data and configuration settings.
  
- Developing cloud-based collaboration tools, project management platforms, or communication platforms where multiple organizations or customers share the same application instance but require data isolation and customization options.
  
- Implementing shared services or marketplaces where multiple tenants can access and transact with shared resources, while maintaining data privacy and security boundaries between tenants.

This library provides a valuable solution for developers and organizations seeking to build scalable, secure, and customizable multi-tenant applications in the .NET ecosystem.
